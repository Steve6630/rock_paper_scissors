This is one of my personal projects on the most famous game of
rock, paper and scissors.
I have implemented random number generator function between 1 to 100 and helped the computer to choose from any three given data. 
There are two functions used on this program one is the main function and the second is the rockpaperscissor function.
The user will have to provide input on the file execution.
Then the function rockpaperscissors will check for the result and return the equivalent flag.
On accepting the flag value the main function will then print the resultant output.
